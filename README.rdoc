== Description

Capp is a packet capture library that wraps pcap.  Capp provides a simple API
for capturing packets and automatically unpacks common packets (including
Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP).  Capp also cooperates with other threads
better than other pcap wrapper libraries for ruby.

== Synopsis

Basic single-thread packet capturing:

  require 'capp'

  Capp.live.loop do |packet|
    # ...
  end

Basic multi-thread packet capturing:

  require 'capp'
  require 'thread'

  q = Queue.new

  Thread.new do
    while packet = q.deq do
      # ...
    end
  end

  capp = Capp.live.loop do |packet|
    q.enq packet
  end

== Requirements
